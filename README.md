Project Topic

-Educating online and to be certified after passing the exams at the end of the education.

Description

-Due to the epidemic, today we have difficulties in improving ourselves and receiving education. That's why we need a platform where distance education can benefit us the most. Our aim is to find a solution to this problem. For this reason, we thought of developing an application. In our practice, we will design a system with videos and quizzes that we can improve ourselves at the end of these trainings and a system where we can repeat these quizzes as much as we want.

Sample Scenario

-The education portal asks the student to become a member of the website.

-Student clicks sign-up button.

-The website asks an email address as an id and determining password to have an account.

-A verification code is sent by the system to the e-mail address entered.

-The student enters the verification code on the site.

-Membership becomes active.

-The student chooses a course according to the field he/she wants to learn.

-The student clicks on the My Courses button and finds the course he/she has chosen.

-The student starts to watch the course consisting of sections from the first part.

-When the part is over, the student takes quizzes which are created for him to try himself.

-The student can repeat the quizzes as many times as he/she wants.

-The student takes the module exam in every third part.
